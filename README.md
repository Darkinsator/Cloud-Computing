# Cloud-Computing
Module 1 to 2 on cloud computing

Module 1:
Cloud computing ecosystems: What is the cloud?

In simple terms the cloud refers to server and storage systems which are assessible through the internet used to allow user the store data, run applications and perform computing tasks without needing to maintain physical hardware on their premises. 

3 services of cloud computing:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Platform as a Service (PaaS): 
Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. Examples include Google App Engine and Microsoft Azure PaaS.

Software as a Service (SaaS): 
Delivers software applications over the internet, typically on a subscription basis. Examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, and Salesforce.

Cloud benefits:
Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
Cost-Effectiveness: Pay only for the resources and services you use.
Accessibility: Access services and data from anywhere with an internet connection.
Reliability: Enhanced redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities.

# Ecosystem of the cloud

There are those who are the consumers of the cloud who buy and use cloud products such as Microsoft Onedrive.
There are the provider of cloud services, these cloud providers offer a variety of functions ranging from infrastructure services to applications and tools.
Designer of services are those companies who build applications and tools. Often services are intended to work within a specific cloud ecosystem or can augment a packaged cloud application.

Cloud Components and Clients
There are three main components in a cloud services solution. The first component is the client platform from which the cloud services are being accessed. The second is the data center where the cloud services are being hosted. The final component is the network connection between those two points.
